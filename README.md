## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students working through the Prework. It has brief information on HTML, CSS, Git & Javascript.

Entering this new subject of study, it was an amazing and challenging experience to build this project while learnig the fundamentals of each required element using HTML, CSS, Git & Javascript.
This project was built to help newcomers like myself as an introduction to working on your first project as a web developer, providing a brief guide to each of the elements used to build this project.
As this is a ongoing process and you are building this project as you are learning, I was taught how to debug where certain coding wasn't functioning and learning to label the issue once detected in order to prevent it from becoming a reoccuring problem.
I learnt how using HTML, CSS, Javascript & Git together produce a final product.
